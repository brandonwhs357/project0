                      <h1> Hi, thanks for visiting my website!</h1>

                      <p> My name is Brandon & I'm currently enrolled in CS50 Intro to Web Programming.</p>

                      <p> The reason why I chose to enroll in this class was to expand my skillset from my current profession. I've always had an interest in learning how to use HTML and JavaScript. </p>

                      <p> I reside in Orange County, CA and enjoy photography, hiking, gymming, playing video games, and budgeting my money.

                      <p> I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Human Resources Management from CSULB in May 2018.  </p>

                      <p> I grew up playing Nintendo and it has been one of my biggest passions. My first video game console was the Nintendo Gamecube, which I received when I was 6, and have continued to play all the family-enriched games Nintendo continues to offer. </p>
