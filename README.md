# Project 0-Brandon Gonzalez
In this project, I decided to focus on showcasing important features using HTML and JavaScript. For starters, in the Home tab, you will see a variety of photos, which each photo representing an interest of mine. From there, if you hover over the photo, you will see a small subtitle or caption of the photo.

In the About tab, I included a photo of myself from January 2019 and the reason why I chose to enroll in this course; as well as my background.

In the Adventures tab, you'll see a table detailing all the places I've traveled to or explored with the following: State, City, and Date of Travel.

In the Work History, I included a small unordered list of my previous employments with different companies.

Each HTML tab and link is easily accessible from any tab and I included the css.html page for reference of any styles I included as well as Bootstrap 4 properties, @media queries, and scss styles like nesting and variables.
